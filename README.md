# easy-umbraco-blog
Umbraco package with document types and partial views for a blog. Created for [webuyanybike](https://www.webuyanybike.co.uk/). Developed on Umbraco 7.4.1. Designed for use with Bootstrap 3

This package won't give you a blog out of the box - but it will give you a set of document types and partial views that you can implement your own templates around.

## How do I use it?
You should zip up the easy-umbraco-blog directory and install it through the Umbraco backoffice (Developer > Packages > Install Local Package)

## Do you offer support?
Open an issue and we'd love to help you out. We'll usually get back to you pretty quick if you contact us during UK business hours.
